# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

This repository contains my solution for the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to predict the sale prices of residential homes based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset provided includes both training and testing data, consisting of features such as size, location, and condition of the properties. The target variable is the sale price of the houses. The dataset can be downloaded from the [competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/).

## Approach

I tackled this regression problem using linear regression, a popular technique in predictive modeling. Linear regression models the relationship between the independent variables and the target variable by fitting a linear equation to the data. Feature engineering and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance model performance.

## Files

- `train.csv`: The training dataset
- `test.csv`: The testing dataset
- `submission.csv`: The predicted sale prices for the test dataset

## Results

The model achieved accurate predictions of house prices, as evaluated by the root mean squared error (RMSE). The solution showcases my skills in regression analysis, data preprocessing, and feature engineering.

## Dependencies

The solution was developed using Python and various data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Make sure to install the necessary dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

To reproduce the results, you can follow these steps:
1. Download the dataset from the competition page.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook or script to train the model and generate predictions.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different algorithms, and further improve the model's performance.

## Conclusion

Participating in the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition using linear regression allowed me to gain hands-on experience in regression modeling, feature engineering, and data analysis. It was an exciting opportunity to apply these techniques to a real-world problem and showcase my skills in the field of predictive modeling.
